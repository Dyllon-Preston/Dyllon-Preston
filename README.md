## About Me

I'm an aerospace engineer passionate about developing intelligent, autonomous systems. Whether it's crafting control frameworks for drone swarms or optimizing multi-phase space trajectories, I focus on solving complex challenges with a blend of analytical rigor and practical experience. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.S. at Georgia Tech while exploring the intersection of robotics, reinforcement learning, and optimal control.
